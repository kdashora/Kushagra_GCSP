                The FSE301 entrepreneurship class has been a pivotal turning point in my academic journey, fundamentally shaping how I approach my team venture with <span className="font-semibold text-white">Devils Prosthetics</span>. From the start of the class to our final Evidence-Based Pitch Deck, I engaged deeply with every stage of the entrepreneurial process.

                    We began by understanding the importance of active listening and empathy. By genuinely engaging with potential users of our prosthetics, I learned not just to hear but to understand their diverse needs and concerns. This foundational step was crucial in shaping our approach to creating solutions that authentically meet user requirements.

                    During the course, I decided to work with my team at Devils Prosthetics to transform it into a successful venture, using this class as a launch pad and learning ground. This required rigorous research and critical thinking, where I explored various sources and methodologies to establish a solid foundation for our proposed solutions.

                    This project was already under development in the EPICS program, and this class helped me refine our pitch for funding. The skills learned in communicating our value proposition led us to win additional funding in various pitch competitions, validating our business model and approach.
