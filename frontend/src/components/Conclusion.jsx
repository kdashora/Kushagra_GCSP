          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
            The Grand Challenges Scholars Program has been one of the most valuable aspects of my undergraduate education. It has transformed me from a student focused primarily on technical skills into a well-rounded engineer prepared to tackle humanity's greatest challenges.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
            What I appreciate most is the program's emphasis on connectivity and theme integration. By requiring students to demonstrate how their experiences interconnect around a central Grand Challenge theme, GCSP encourages holistic thinking rather than compartmentalized learning.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-8">
            I now understand that engineering is not just about building things; it's about building a better future for all people.

            <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
              One suggestion for enhancing the program would be to create more structured opportunities for GCSP scholars to collaborate across different Grand Challenge themes. Interdisciplinary collaboration between scholars working on different themes could generate innovative solutions that address multiple challenges simultaneously, reflecting the interconnected nature of global problems.
